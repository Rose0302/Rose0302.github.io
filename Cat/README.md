This project is dedicated to showcasing the feline residents of Saadiyat Island
The overall concept of this website is to provide a fun and educational guidences for cat lovers, while featuring a collection of photos and stories about the cats and their lives on the island.
The theme is to create a space where people can appreciate and learn about the cats that call Saadiyat Island their home.

* Reflection/Evaluation:
In the process of building the Saadiyat cat lover blog, the expectations and goals were successfully met in terms of creating a visually appealing and user-friendly platform that showcases the feline residents of Saadiyat Island. The website effectively conveys the message of my appreciation and love for the cats. During the process of building the website, I realized it is important to organize code from the beginning in order to create an efficient and functional website. Failure to organize the code can result in spending a lot of time searching for codes and making changes, which can slow down the entire development process. Having everything organized can help to save time and ensure a more streamlined development process.
